# Playing with SWAPI

Just a playground for Vue.js first steps consuming from SWAPI with axios.

The initial boilerplate was extracted from GeeksHubs Academy's 'Curso de Vue 2 para iniciarse en el mundo de las SPA' course by [Francisco Casero](https://github.com/Dygerydoo).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
